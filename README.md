## the MicroGravity Vibration Reduction project, affectionately known as "MacGyver"

This is a project being sent to the International Space Station by students from MA. Only MA students may commit to this repository.

We are attempting to reduce vibrations in microgravity by using Nitinol wire as an actuator to counteract incoming vibrations.

More details to come.
